1.  [Exercise 1:Write a Python regex function to find sequences of lowercase letters joined with an underscore.](https://github.com/dexterneutron/pybootcamp/blob/master/level_4/lowregex.py)

2.  [Exercise 2:Create a unit testing to extensively test all possibilities of the function created in the regex exercise above.](https://github.com/dexterneutron/pybootcamp/blob/master/level_4/testregex.py)

3.  [Exercise 3:Create a decorator that makes sure that all function arguments where it's applied will match the regex on the regex exercise above.](https://github.com/dexterneutron/pybootcamp/blob/master/level_4/regexvalidation.py)
