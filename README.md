Here you can find the exercises for the Python Bootcamp



## Level 1: Getting started with Python

1.  [Write a Python program to test whether a passed letter is a vowel or not.](https://github.com/dexterneutron/pybootcamp/blob/master/level_1/vowels.py)
    
2.  [Write a Python program that accepts the user's first and last name and prints them in reverse order with a space between them.](https://github.com/dexterneutron/pybootcamp/blob/master/level_1/reversed.py)
    
3.  [Write a Python program that accepts a filename from the user and prints the filenameâ€™s extension.](https://github.com/dexterneutron/pybootcamp/blob/master/level_1/fileextention.py)  
    _Sample filename : abc.java_  
    _Output : java_
    
4.  [Write a Python program to count the number of lines in a text file.](https://github.com/dexterneutron/pybootcamp/blob/master/level_1/textlines.py)
    
5.  [Write a Python program to count the frequency of words in a text file.](https://github.com/dexterneutron/pybootcamp/blob/master/level_1/wordfrecuency.py)
    
6.  [Write a Python program that takes an input string from the user and counts the frequency of characters in the string.](https://github.com/dexterneutron/pybootcamp/blob/master/level_1/charfrecuency.py)  
    _Sample String : google.com_  
    _Expected Result : {'g': 2, 'o': 3, 'l': 1, 'e': 1, '.': 1, 'c': 1, 'm': 1}_
    
7.  [Write a Python function to remove duplicates from a list.](https://github.com/dexterneutron/pybootcamp/blob/master/level_1/removeduplicates.py)
    
8.  [Write a Python function to remove an item from a tuple.](https://github.com/dexterneutron/pybootcamp/blob/master/level_1/removefromtuple.py)
    
9.  [Write a Python function to merge two dictionaries.](https://github.com/dexterneutron/pybootcamp/blob/master/level_1/mergedicts.py)
    
10.  [Write a Python program that iterates through integers from 1 to 100 and prints them. For integers that are multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number. For integers that are multiples of five, print "Buzz". For integers which are multiples of both three and five print, "FizzBuzz".](https://github.com/dexterneutron/pybootcamp/blob/master/level_1/fizzbuzz.py)
