## Level 3: Getting to know advanced level python techniques

1.  [Exercise 1: Write a Python program to count the number of strings where the string length is 2 or more and the first and last character are the same from a given list of strings.](https://github.com/dexterneutron/pybootcamp/blob/master/level_3/countstrings.py)

2.  [Exercise 2: Write a Python program to display the current date and time.](https://github.com/dexterneutron/pybootcamp/blob/master/level_3/currentdatetime.py)

3.  [Exercise 3 Write a Python program that asks the user for their birth date and prints the user’s current age in years, months, and days.Sample output: You are 25 years, 4 months, and 22 days old](https://github.com/dexterneutron/pybootcamp/blob/master/level_3/userage.py)
 
4.  [Exercise 4 Write a Python function using list comprehension  that receives a list of words and returns a list that contains: -The number of characters in each word if the word has 3 or more characters -The string “x” if the word has fewer than 3 characters](https://github.com/dexterneutron/pybootcamp/blob/master/level_3/listofwords.py) 

5.  [Write a Python program that reads a JSON object from a file, sorts the object keys in ascending order, then writes the JSON object back into the file.](https://github.com/dexterneutron/pybootcamp/blob/master/level_3/readjson.py) 

6.  [Write a python file with two functions: a function that receives a number and appends to a global variable list, and another function that returns this list ordered.](https://github.com/dexterneutron/pybootcamp/blob/master/level_3/globallist.py)
